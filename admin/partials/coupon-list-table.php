 * Example List Table Child Class
 *
 * Create a new list table package that extends the core WP_List_Table class.
 * WP_List_Table contains most of the framework for generating the table, but we
 * need to define and override some methods so that our data can be displayed
 * exactly the way we need it to be.
 *
 * To display this example on a page, you will first need to instantiate the class,
 * then call $yourInstance->prepare_items() to handle any data manipulation, then
 * finally call $yourInstance->display() to render the table to the page.
 *
 * Our topic for this list table is going to be movies.
